number-parse
============

A fast templated number parsing library in C++.

##Speed Tests:
#####Requires `boost` for `lexical_cast`

Commands were generated by compiling `speed-string-to-int.cpp`, and then
interpreted by `interpret.go` into an svg plot as such:

```
g++ speed-string-to-int.cpp -I/opt/local/include -o ./speedtest
./speedtest | go run interpret.go
```

This test shows that ExtractInt is about 5% faster than the next fastest
number parser. The consistency compared to other methods is also notable.
I still have more optimization to do as well.

#Usage:
The methods accept an iterator and only consume as much as they need to.
They stop consuming at the first character which isn't a match to the number patterns.

Iterators are simply anything with a increment `++` operator, as no backtracking is needed or done.
##Methods:
The methods follow a simple style pattern PrefixSuffix (e.g. __ParseInt__).

The prefixes denote iterator access:
- Parse: The iterator is modified.
- Extract: The iterator is copied and not modified.

The suffixes denote the type to scan for:
- UInt: unsigned integer
- Int: integer
- UFloat: unsigned float
- Float: float
